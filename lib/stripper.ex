  Stripper is a package made to help you normalize input from web scraping (or
  other questionable sources).

  It accomplishes this via parsing an input in a single pass without regular
  expressions.

  ## Use Cases

  - `Stripper.Whitespace` : for normalizing all kinds of whitespace and stripping it.
  - `Stripper.Quotes` : for normalizing all kinds of quotes to their simplest equivalents: `"` and `'`.

  More planned...
